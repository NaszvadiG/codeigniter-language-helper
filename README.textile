h1.  Language Helper

This is a very small language_helper extension that adds a $var parameter to the lang() function.

h2.  Compatibility

This will work with CodeIgniter 1.7.x and 2.0.

h2.  Installation

Copy the MY_language_helper.php file into your application/helpers folder.

h2.  Usage

In your language files you can now put variables inside your strings, prepended with a colon (:).

Example:

<pre><code>$lang['welcome'] = 'Hello :name, how are you? Today is :date!';</code></pre>

Then when you call the lang() helper function you send an array with the variable values.

Example:
<pre><code><?php echo lang('welcome', array(':name' => 'Dan', ':date' => date('l'))); ?></code></pre>

And this would output:

"Hello Dan, how are you? Today is Friday!"
